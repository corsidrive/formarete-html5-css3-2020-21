    <div class="box">The above commands create a Flutter project directory called <span class="word">myapp</span>
        that contains a simple demo app that uses <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 255)">Material Components</span>
    </div>
    <p class="note">
        <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i><strong>Note</strong>: When creating a new Flutter app, some Flutter IDE plugins ask for a company domain name in reverse order,
        something like com.example. The company domain name and project name are used together as the package name for
        Android (the Bundle ID for iOS) when the app is released. If you think that the app might be released, it’s
        better to specify the package name now. The package name can’t be changed once the app is released, so make the
        name unique

    <p class="warning">
        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i><strong>Warning</strong>: If VS Code was running during your initial Flutter setup, you may need to restart it for VS Code’s Flutter
        plugin to detect the Flutter SDK.
    </p>
    <p class="tip">
        <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i><strong>Tip</strong>: The code for your app is in <span class="word">lib/main.dart</span>. For a high-level description of what each code block does, see the
        comments at the top of that file.
